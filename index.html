If that's what it takes to get  there that's how badly I want it. I don't want to be the hero. I don't want to be the last boss. I want to be the one in the story who operates from the shadows, showing everyone their greatness: The Eminence in Shadow!</p>

            <h3>Piano Proficiency</h3>
            <p>I'm  a skilled pianist who can play Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata", which is my favorite musical piece and for which I'm most skilled with it and have knowledge and ability to play other musical notes. I also like to play ,"Darling in the Night" sometimes.</p>

            <h3>I am Atomic.</h3>
            <p>My signature technique is the result of all of my hard work to finally defeat my last challenge (of surviving a nuclear weapon by becoming a nuclear weapon) in where I pour much of my power into my blade into a devastating strike that once struck against its target, he or she will disintegrate followed by a nuclear explosion that can shake the land to pieces and even affect space. The attack can also project a barrier ensuring anyone outside it would not be affected by the attack. Notably, it does not leave any radiation behind like a real nuclear explosion.</p>

            <h3>Knowledge of Science and Business</h3>
            <p>I Know various sciences; economy, commerce, and agriculture, among others which I've managed to retain although in a somewhat vague way from my previous life. That knowledge has served to help me educate my subordinates nearby, "the Seven Shadows". I've trained them since they were little when I rescued them. They have used the knowledge taught by me to manage to recreate and use the things that I knew from my previous life</p>
